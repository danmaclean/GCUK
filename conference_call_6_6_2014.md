* The current draft of a website with our very preliminary ideas and some bad graphics is at [http://galaxy-community.org.uk/](http://galaxy-community.org.uk/)
* Here is the map of concepts we've been throwing round for this

## Purpose of talk today:

 * Define how a GCUK can serve the UK Galaxy Community
   * Who are the UK galaxy community
   * What do they need
   * How do we serve that community

## UK Galaxy setups:

 * TSL: Bioinformatics, Admins. Bench biologists are main users. Bioinformatics team administer local instance, provide training, write tools, etc.
 * Manchester: Small but growing, training, for University - currently largely used for training (distance learning course, one-day intro to NGS courses), bioinformatics core facility analysts use for specific parts of analyses & to hand back to end users, small number of users for bespoke tools for specific analyses
 * Cambridge: Mostly end users, small community, galaxy server at cancer research, interested in developing training solutions using Galaxy
 * James Hutton Institute: Internal server with ~30 users right now, soft launch over the last year - initially within what was the Plant Pathology group, with expectation of offering internal training and use to the full Institute. Usage could expand, especially now more integrated with central cluster and storage.
 * Dundee: initial Galaxy install from about 3-4 years ago. Mostly used to share/disseminate tools and scripts to non-bioinformaticians within the College. Thought about using it within bioinformatics group, but too inflexible. Gone stale due to low take-up. Now, wishing to relaunch as a 'value-added' proposition from our sequencing facility. Initally to support only specific pipelines (e.g. RNAseq)

## On the website:
Do not want to step on toes of main Galaxy community content.

Here is the main Galaxy Stack Exchange / BioStar Q&A site: [https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/)
possibility of a smaller stack excange style support area

## Meetings and Events:
Include a BOF/sub-committee style meeting to one of the larger next-gen/Bioinformatics meetings in the UK.
Would there be scope in principle in the future for a UK GCC-style one- or two-day meeting each year?

Galaxy news, updates, 'whats happening with galaxy', newsletters/news-digests?

## UK Community for technical support
Should we also think about having a directory of Galaxy users across the UK?
We are starting something along thoes lines, We are listing UK galaxy servers, both public and private. It would be nice to extend this to users as well. I agree, THere is currently a map available at http://galaxy-community.org.uk/galaxy-servers/ that covers servers, This is currently very small but we are add as we go.

How to keep up with tools available? 
 * Potted history of updates
 * Do we need news digests? I think this would cover some of the issues raised with the curent news channels
 * Fit this in with training materials

**What are motivations for getting biologists and bioinformaticians to talk more freely?**
A hub for adding training materials for both to resolve tensions between bioinformaticians who don't want to share methods and biologists who are nervous about using them. 
**Biologists are starting to realise that biology is now a data science in many areas**, so need help with that. Galaxy is a less scary intro to bioinformatics.

**Stack exchange** style thing (already on Galaxy main)

**Galaxy Main UK?!** Interesting idea if there are suitable existing compute resources we could build on... or a big grant would be needed.
Not sure. Data privacy issues. Is Galaxy user model robust enough?


**Galaxy newsletters too complicated?**, Some people drop out of the loop and come back not knowing what has changed,

**Motivating bioligists into using Galaxy, Training options**
I don't think motivation is an issue. More and more are actively asking to do 'bioinformatics stuff'. Focus on these and grow from there. The issue was to motivate bioinformaticians to share tools through galaxy, even develop pipelines in there in the firstplace. 

**Galaxy Developer Dannon Baker will be on a European Tour this autumn**, including visiting Cambridge for the Genome Informatics Meeting 21-24 September 2014) https://registration.hinxton.wellcome.ac.uk/display_info.asp?id=406 - that might be a good time for a possible in-person meeting (some of you may also be interested in [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/EU-Codefest_2014 18-19 September 2014)](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/EU-Codefest_2014 18-19 September 2014).
